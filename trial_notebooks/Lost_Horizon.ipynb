The two cart-horses,\\nBoxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting\\ndown their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be\\nsome small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout\\nmotherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her\\nfigure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast,\\nnearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary\\nhorses put together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a\\nsomewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate\\nintelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness\\nof character and tremendous powers of work. After the horses came\\nMuriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the\\noldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom\\ntalked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical\\nremark—for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to\\nkeep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and\\nno flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. If\\nasked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.\\nNevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer;\\nthe two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small\\npaddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never\\nspeaking.'},\n",
