                                PROLOGUE




Cigars had burned low, and we were beginning to sample the disillusionment...





                                CHAPTER 1

During that third week of May the situation in Baskul had become much worse...





                                CHAPTER 2

The journey was expected to be long and perilous...

They shook hands, and Mallinson left.



Conway sat alone in the lantern-light. It seemed to him, in a phrase
engraved on memory, that all the loveliest things were transient and
perishable, that the two worlds were finally beyond reconciliation, and
that one of them hung, as always, by a thread. After he had pondered for
some time he looked at his watch; it was ten minutes to three.





                                EPILOGUE


Continuing, he said: “The little fellow
looked at me solemnly for a moment, and then answered in that funny
clipped English that the educated Chinese have—‘Oh no, she was most
old—most old of anyone I have ever seen.’”



We sat for a long time in silence.
